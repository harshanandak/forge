/**
 * Lazy `.forge/` home creation (activation foundation).

 * Discovery ≠ initialization. The global Forge plugin (SessionStart hook +
 * `activation` skill) must create NOTHING in a user's repo. The FIRST verb that
 * performs a real MUTATION (e.g. `forge claim`, `forge create`, `forge
 * remember`) is what lazily materializes the bare-minimum `.forge/` skeleton.
 * Read-only verbs (`ready`, `show`, `status`, `recap`, …) never call this, so a
 * bare repo stays untouched until the user actually changes state.
 *
 * "Bare-minimum" here is strictly LESS than `forge init --minimal`: this writes
 * ONLY `.forge/config.yaml` with every gate disabled (the `minimal` adoption
 * profile). It installs NO git hooks, NO lefthook.yml, NO protected-paths
 * manifest, NO `.mcp.json`, and NO scripts tree — those remain the opt-in
 * payload of `forge setup`, never forced. Progressive growth: heavier slices
 * initialize themselves on first use.

/**
 * Core verbs that MUTATE project state and therefore need `.forge/` to exist.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes `init`/`setup` — they own `.forge/` creation with their
 * own (richer) logic, and pre-creating a minimal config would trip their
 * no-clobber guard. Also excludes every read-only verb, so those write nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDES `gate` and `stage`: each has read-only subcommands
 * (`gate status`/`gate check`, `stage --list`/`--current`) that must not create
 * `.forge/` — a verb-level trigger would violate the foundation's own
 * "read-only writes nothing" invariant. Their genuinely-mutating forms
 * self-manage without ensureForgeHome: `gate enable|disable` and `role` write
 * via the config writer (which creates `.forge/config.yaml` if absent), while
 * `gate approve|reject` and `stage --start|--complete` write kernel events/runs
 * through the broker (which lazily creates its own store). Subcommand-level
 * granularity is deferred; excluding the whole verb is the correct, safe default
 * because the read-only forms are the common case. `role` is retained: it has NO
 * read-only form (every valid invocation writes config), so it violates nothing.
 *
 * A command module may override membership by exporting `mutating: true|false`;
 * this Set is the default classification for the foundation.
