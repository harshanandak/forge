# Project Workflow Instructions

## Default TDD-First Workflow Template

This project ships a **default TDD-first workflow template** with 6 workflow stages plus a composable **research** skill (a phase of `/plan` and usable standalone). In v3, these stages are one configurable composition over Forge runtime building blocks, not a product-wide mandatory ladder. Commands may be invoked as full stages or as smaller skill fragments when the active plan permits it. Pre-merge is an embedded gate in `/ship` and `/review` (not a numbered stage); `/status` and `/shepherd` are utilities (not stages).

| Stage | Command     | Purpose                                                   | Required For |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1     | `/plan`     | Design intent → research → branch + worktree + task list | Critical, Standard, Refactor |
| 2     | `/dev`      | Subagent-driven TDD per task (spec + quality review)     | All types    |
| 3     | `/validate`    | Validate + 4-phase debug mode on failure                    | All types    |
| 4     | `/ship`     | Create PR with documentation                             | All types    |
| 5     | `/review`   | Address ALL PR feedback                                  | Critical, Standard |
| 6     | `/verify`   | Post-merge health check (CI, deployments)                | All types    |

**Pre-merge gate (not a numbered stage)**: Completing docs on the feature branch and handing off the PR for merge is a **task-type gate and checkpoint**, not a standalone workflow stage. The gate runs for Critical, Standard, and Refactor work and is embedded in the `/ship` and `/review` stages — finish the doc updates, confirm CI is green, then hand off the PR. Simple, Hotfix, and Docs work skip the gate.

**Utility**: `/status` — Context check before starting work (not a numbered stage)

**Utility**: `/shepherd <pr>` — Autonomous PR ownership. `forge shepherd daemon` is a singleton reconcile daemon that owns **all** open PRs for the repo: it converges CI/check state into kernel verdicts, re-runs flaky required checks (Tier-A), reaps orphan watchers, and self-retires when no PRs remain — so agents read verdicts (`forge shepherd <pr> --pull --json`, `forge shepherd events`) instead of hand-polling. `forge shepherd <pr>` is the one-shot bounded pass for a single PR. It is a utility, **not** a workflow stage. It **never merges** (the human merges in the GitHub UI) and **never resolves review threads** (that stays with `/review`). `--auto-rebase` is opt-in and default OFF; kill-switches: `FORGE_SHEPHERD_DISABLE`, `forge gate disable rail.auto_shepherd`. See [docs/reference/shepherd.md](docs/reference/shepherd.md).

## Automatic Change Classification

When the user requests work, **you MUST automatically classify** the change type:

### Critical (Full default workflow template)
**Triggers:** Security, authentication, payments, breaking changes, new architecture, data migrations
**Example:** "Add OAuth login", "Migrate database schema", "Implement payment gateway"
**Workflow:** plan → dev → validate → ship → review → verify (pre-merge gate before merge)

### Standard (default workflow without post-merge verify)
**Triggers:** Normal features, enhancements, new components
**Example:** "Add user profile page", "Create notification system"
**Workflow:** plan → dev → validate → ship → review (pre-merge gate before merge)

### Simple (3-stage workflow, skip plan)
**Triggers:** Bug fixes, UI tweaks, small changes, minor refactors
**Example:** "Fix button color", "Update validation message", "Adjust padding"
**Workflow:** dev → validate → ship

### Hotfix (Emergency 3-stage workflow)
**Triggers:** Production emergencies, critical bugs affecting users
**Example:** "Production payment processing down", "Security vulnerability fix"
**Workflow:** dev → validate → ship (immediate merge allowed)

### Docs (Documentation-only workflow)
**Triggers:** Documentation updates, README changes, comment improvements
**Example:** "Update README", "Add API documentation"
**Workflow:** verify → ship

### Refactor (5-stage workflow for safe cleanup)
**Triggers:** Code cleanup, performance optimization, technical debt reduction
**Example:** "Refactor auth service", "Extract utility functions"
**Workflow:** plan → dev → validate → ship (pre-merge gate before merge)

## Enforcement Philosophy

**Conversational, not blocking** - Offer solutions when prerequisites are missing:

❌ **Don't:** "ERROR: Research required for critical features"
✅ **Do:** "Before implementation, I should research OAuth best practices. I can:
   1. Auto-research now with parallel-deep-research (~5 min)
   2. Use your research if you have it
   3. Skip (not recommended for security features)

   What would you prefer?"

**Create accountability for skips:**

"Skipping tests creates technical debt. I'll:
 ✓ Allow this commit
 ✓ Create follow-up issue for tests
 ✓ Document in commit message as [tech-debt]

 Proceed?"

**Dynamic commands — no hardcoded examples:**

Command files (`.claude/commands/*.md` and agent equivalents) must never hardcode example output when a script generates that output dynamically. Reference the script and describe what it does — don't duplicate its output with fake data that becomes stale.

## TDD Development (`/dev` Command)

**Subagent-driven per-task implementation loop:**

1. **Read task list** → Pre-made task list from `/plan` Phase 3 at `docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/tasks.md`
2. **Dispatch implementer subagent per task** → Fresh context, complete task text, relevant design doc sections
3. **TDD inside implementer** → RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforced by HARD-GATE:
   - RED: Write failing test first (must run test and show failing output)
   - GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass (must show passing output)
   - REFACTOR: Clean up while keeping tests green
4. **Spec compliance review** → Spec reviewer checks every task before quality review
5. **Code quality review** → Quality reviewer checks after spec compliance ✅
6. **Decision gate** → 7-dimension impact scoring when spec gap found; score routes to PROCEED/SPEC-REVIEWER/BLOCKED

**Example execution:**
```
/dev starts:
  ✓ Read task list: docs/work/2026-02-26-stripe-billing/tasks.md (8 tasks)
  ✓ Created decisions log: docs/work/2026-02-26-stripe-billing/decisions.md

Task 1: Types and interfaces
  ✓ Implementer: test written → failing → implementation → passing → committed
  ✓ Spec review: ✅
  ✓ Quality review: ✅
  Decision gates: 0

Task 2: Validation logic
  ✓ Implementer: test written → failing → implementation → passing
  ⚠️  Decision gate fired (score: 2/14 — PROCEED)
     Gap: Error message format not specified in design doc
     Choice: Use { code, message } object (conservative, documented)
  ✓ Spec review: ✅
  ✓ Quality review: ✅
```

## State Management (Single Source of Truth)

> GitHub issue lifecycle may sync to Beads via CI -- see [docs/guides/BEADS_GITHUB_SYNC.md](docs/guides/BEADS_GITHUB_SYNC.md).

**Current implementation**: The Forge Kernel is the default issue-state authority; issue commands read and write the kernel store unless Beads is explicitly selected (`--issue-backend beads`, `FORGE_ISSUE_BACKEND=beads`, or `issueBackend: beads` in `.forge/config.yaml`), where it serves as an import/export/projection compatibility layer. **Direction (D44)**: continue consolidating issue/workflow/run authority in the Kernel with Beads remaining a compatibility projection. New authority work must follow [docs/work/2026-04-28-skeleton-pivot/forge-kernel-authority-control-plane.md](docs/work/2026-04-28-skeleton-pivot/forge-kernel-authority-control-plane.md) and [docs/reference/FORGE_KERNEL_STORAGE_MODEL.md](docs/reference/FORGE_KERNEL_STORAGE_MODEL.md).

## Git Hooks & Push Workflow (Automatic Enforcement)

This project uses the **Professional Git Workflow** with Lefthook for automated quality gates.

**Pre-commit hook enforces TDD:**
- Blocks commits if source code modified without test files
- Offers guided recovery (add tests now, skip with tech debt tracking, emergency override)
- No AI decision required - automatic validation
- **Strong default, not a hard floor.** The TDD gate is the default-ON `rail.tdd_intent` rail; turn it off with `forge gate disable rail.tdd_intent` (the `minimal` adoption profile ships it off). The installed hooks read the resolved config at run time, so a disabled rail makes them genuinely inert — enforcement honestly follows your config.

**Pre-push hook validates tests:**
- Branch protection: blocks direct push to `main`/`master`
- ESLint: blocks on errors and warnings (strict mode, `--max-warnings 0`)
- All tests must pass before push
- Can skip for hotfixes with documentation

**Pull Request workflow:**
- PR template auto-fills with a standardized format; the self-review checklist catches most bugs before review
- Reference the issue id in the PR body (e.g. the Forge Kernel issue id); **all review comments must be resolved** before merge
- Squash-only merging for a clean, linear history

**⚠️ AI agents must NEVER use `LEFTHOOK=0`, `--no-verify`, or any hook bypass.** If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue. Only humans may bypass hooks in emergencies, documented in the PR description.

**Preferred push workflow (AI agents and humans):**

```bash
forge push                    # Branch protection + lint + tests, then push
forge push --quick            # Review-cycle: lint-only push (CI runs full suite)
forge worktree create <slug>  # Create a worktree
forge test                    # Run tests with correct timeouts
forge sync                    # Sync issue data
forge clean                   # Remove merged worktrees
```

## Build, Shell, and MCP

**Package manager**: Bun (preferred for performance).

```bash
bun install      # Install dependencies
bun run dev      # Start development
bun run build    # Production build
bun test         # Run tests
```

**GitHub CLI**: `gh auth login` for the PR workflow.

### Shell Model

| Platform | Shell used by Forge commands and scripts |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Git Bash for helper-backed Forge stage flows |
| macOS/Linux | Default login shell |

On Windows, Forge runtime health enforces Git Bash for helper-backed stage flows. Native PowerShell is still used by some bootstrap paths, and WSL may be useful for adjacent development tasks. See [docs/reference/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/reference/TOOLCHAIN.md#shell-model).

### MCP Servers (Optional)

If your agent supports MCP, these enhance research:

- **Context7** - up-to-date library documentation and API reference
- **grep.app** - search 1M+ GitHub repos for real-world code examples

See [.mcp.json.example](.mcp.json.example) for configuration (Claude Code: copy it to `.mcp.json`) and [docs/reference/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/reference/TOOLCHAIN.md) for detailed setup.

## Descriptive Context Convention

Every stage transition should carry structured context so the next stage (or a new session) can resume without re-reading the full design doc. This convention is **advisory** — warnings are informational, not blocking.

### Required Fields at Each Stage Exit

| Stage Exit | Summary | Decisions | Artifacts | Next |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| /plan      | Design approach chosen | Key trade-offs resolved | Design doc, task list paths | First dev task focus |
| /dev       | Tasks completed, gate count | Spec gaps encountered | Changed files, test files | Validation priorities |
| /validate  | All checks pass/fail summary | Failures diagnosed | Scripts/commands run | Ship readiness |
| /ship      | PR created, checks pending | Template sections filled | PR URL, branch name | Review focus areas |
| /review    | All feedback addressed | Comment resolutions | Fixed files, commit SHAs | Doc update needs |
| pre-merge gate | Docs updated, CI green | N/A | Updated doc files | Merge instructions |

### Recording Stage Context

Record the stage-exit context as a kernel issue comment so the next stage (or a
fresh session) can resume from the issue record itself:

```bash
forge issue comment <issue-id> "stage: dev -> validate
summary: All 5 tasks done, 1 decision gate fired
decisions: Used streaming parser over DOM for memory efficiency
artifacts: lib/parser.js test/parser.test.js
next: Run lint first — streaming approach may trigger no-await rule"
```

Check-after-write verification (`gate.issue_verify`, default-on) confirms the
comment actually landed. Read context back with `forge show <issue-id>` (or
`forge recap <issue-id>` for the bounded orientation envelope).

### Field Definitions

- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence recap of what was accomplished in this stage. Example: `--summary "All 5 tasks done, 1 decision gate fired"`
- **Decisions**: Key choices made during this stage that affect downstream work. Example: `--decisions "Used streaming parser over DOM for memory efficiency"`
- **Artifacts**: File paths or URLs produced by this stage. Example: `--artifacts "lib/parser.js test/parser.test.js docs/work/2026-03-26-parser/plan.md"`
- **Next**: Guidance for the next stage on what to focus on. Example: `--next "Run lint first — streaming approach may trigger no-await rule"`

### Enforcement Level

This convention is **advisory only** — missing fields never block a stage
transition. The goal is to build good habits, not to create friction.

## Forge Issue Tracker

This project uses the **Forge Kernel** for issue tracking. Run `forge prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
forge ready           # Find available work
forge show <id>       # View issue details
forge claim <id>      # Claim work
forge close <id>      # Complete work
```

**More commands worth knowing** (run `forge <command> --help` for full usage):

```bash
forge remember <note>          # Persist a project-memory note to a file-backed store
forge recall [query]           # Retrieve project-memory notes back (the read half of remember)
forge insights                 # Detect recurring evidence patterns, suggest conservative follow-ups
forge upgrade                  # Preview and self-heal safe Forge upgrade readiness
forge gate <verb> <gate-id>    # Toggle a workflow gate, or record/query human-gate approval events
forge role <role> --use <skill> # Bind a role to a skill/ideology in .forge/config.yaml
forge merge --auto <pr>        # Opt-in conditional auto-merge — merges only when configured rules pass (OFF by default)
```

### Rules

- Use `forge` as the routine command surface for issue tracking and sync workflows — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists. Exception: `/plan` Phase 3 generates task lists at `docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/tasks.md` — these are approved artifacts consumed by `/dev`. New issue-authority work routes through the Forge Kernel design. Use `forge issue` subcommands (e.g. `forge issue dep`, `forge issue comment`) for operations beyond the shortcuts above. GitHub issues may be used for external/public tracking; CI may sync GitHub issue lifecycle to the issue store.
- Run `forge prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `forge remember` for persistent knowledge and `forge recall` to retrieve it back — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

### Kernel Tracking (nothing discussed goes missing)

**NON-NEGOTIABLE, default-on.** Anything raised in a session — a bug, an idea, a
design decision, a follow-up, a TODO, a risk noticed in passing — MUST become a
Forge Kernel issue **immediately** via `forge issue create`, before it can be
forgotten. Triage it (set a type, link its epic/parent) so it is discoverable.
When you defer scope, file the follow-up issue and reference it — never leave
work unfiled. The Kernel is the single source of truth; do NOT substitute
TodoWrite, markdown TODO lists, or memory notes for a filed issue.

This policy is canonicalized in `rules/kernel-tracking.md` (rendered to every
port: `.cursor/rules/kernel-tracking.mdc` for Cursor, this projection for
Claude/Codex/Hermes) and governed by the default-on `rail.kernel_tracking`
runtime rail. Turn it off only deliberately: `forge gate disable rail.kernel_tracking`.

## Project Learnings

- **Scope discipline**: Do ONLY what was explicitly asked. Answer a question → stop. Check something → stop. Never auto-continue to next steps or pending work unless told to.
- **Stage names**: The validation stage command is `/validate` — renamed in PR #50; do not use the old name.
- **Unused params**: Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_searchTerm`) — ESLint `no-unused-vars` enforced with `--max-warnings 0`.
- **Pre-push test env**: `test-env/` fixture tests can fail during actual `git push` due to git mid-push state. Fix the root cause — never use `LEFTHOOK=0`.
- **Skill sync**: Canonical skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; per-agent copies are generated from them. `.agents/skills` (Codex's repo-local discovery path) is committed so a fresh clone gets discovery without `forge setup` — a pre-commit hook keeps it byte-identical to `skills/` and the drift gate enforces it. The other mirrors (`.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.hermes/skills`) are gitignored and regenerated at `forge setup`. Never hand-edit a generated mirror — edit the canonical `skills/` source.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    forge sync     # wraps the supported issue-store sync flow when the issue store is configured
    git push
    git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- After fixing review feedback, always push the changes and resolve the related GitHub review threads via the GraphQL API before considering the work complete
