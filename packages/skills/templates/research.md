## Purpose

This research skill helps you gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive insights.

## When to Use

- User asks for market research, competitive analysis, or industry trends
- User needs current information beyond your knowledge cutoff
- User requests data extraction or web scraping
- User wants to understand a new technology, framework, or concept
- User needs citations and sources for their research

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Understand the research question and scope
2. Identify key search terms and concepts
3. Determine relevant sources (documentation, articles, papers, repos)

### Phase 2: Data Collection
1. Use web search tools to find relevant sources
2. Extract key information from each source
3. Note credibility indicators (author, date, citations)
4. Capture direct quotes with proper attribution

### Phase 3: Analysis
1. Synthesize information across sources
2. Identify patterns, trends, and contradictions
3. Evaluate quality and reliability of sources
4. Form evidence-based conclusions

### Phase 4: Presentation
1. Structure findings logically (problem → research → insights → conclusions)
2. Include citations for all claims
3. Highlight key takeaways
4. Suggest next steps or areas for further research

## Tools Required

- Web search tool (e.g., WebSearch, parallel-ai)
- Web fetch tool (for reading specific URLs)
- Document analysis capabilities

## Examples

### Example 1: Technology Research
```
Input: "Research the current state of vector databases in 2026"
Output:
- Overview of popular solutions (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus)
- Key features comparison table
- Performance benchmarks
- Use case recommendations
- Citations from official docs and recent articles
```

### Example 2: Market Analysis
```
Input: "Analyze the AI coding assistant market"
Output:
- Market size and growth projections
- Key players (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Feature comparison matrix
- Pricing models
- Market trends and future outlook
- Sources from industry reports
```
