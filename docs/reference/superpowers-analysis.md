## What Is Superpowers?

**Repository**: https://github.com/obra/superpowers
**Author**: Jesse Vincent (@obra) — keyboard designer at keyboard.io, creator of K-9 Mail for Android, former Perl 5 project lead
**Description**: "An agentic skills framework & software development methodology that works."
**License**: MIT
**Version**: v4.3.1 (2026-02-21)
**Language**: Shell
**Stars**: ~62,000 (4th most installed plugin in Claude Code marketplace, surpassed GitHub's own plugin)
**Source**: https://www.threads.com/@obrajesse/post/DVANeBYEfuF/ — Jesse Vincent's own announcement

Superpowers is a **Claude Code plugin** (also supports Cursor, Codex, OpenCode) that ships a library of 14 composable "skills" — structured instructions the agent reads and follows automatically. Skills trigger based on context, not user commands. The agent reads the right skill before taking action.

## Core Workflow (How It Runs)

```
1. brainstorming      → Explore context → ask questions one at a time → propose 2-3 approaches
                        → present design in sections → user approves → write design doc to
                        docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md → commit

2. using-git-worktrees → Create isolated workspace on new branch → run project setup
                         → verify clean test baseline

3. writing-plans      → Break approved design into tasks (2-5 min each)
                        → each task: exact file paths, complete code, verification steps

4. subagent-driven-development OR executing-plans
                      → Fresh subagent per task
                        → Two-stage review: (1) spec compliance, (2) code quality

5. test-driven-development → RED fails → GREEN passes → REFACTOR → commit
                             → Deletes code written before tests

6. requesting-code-review → Reviews against plan, reports by severity
                            → Critical issues block progress

7. finishing-a-development-branch → Verify tests → present options (merge/PR/keep/discard)
                                    → clean up worktree
```

**Key mechanic**: Skills auto-trigger based on context. The agent checks for relevant skills before any task. No user command needed.

## The HARD-GATE Pattern

The brainstorming skill uses explicit blocking tags:

```
<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project,
or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user
has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>
```

**Why this matters**: This is a structural enforcement mechanism — not a soft instruction. It explicitly names forbidden actions and conditions. Soft instructions ("read AGENTS.md first") fail. Hard gates with explicit prohibitions work.

## Forge vs Superpowers: Side-by-Side

### What Both Do (Overlap)

| Capability | Forge | Superpowers |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| TDD enforcement | `/dev` RED-GREEN-REFACTOR | `test-driven-development` skill |
| Planning phase | `/plan` command + Beads | `writing-plans` skill |
| Code review | `/review` command | `requesting-code-review` + `receiving-code-review` |
| Parallel agents | Parallel AI skills | `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill |
| PR workflow | `/ship`, `/premerge` | `finishing-a-development-branch` |

### What Superpowers Has That Forge Doesn't

| Gap | Superpowers Solution | Forge Status |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| **Design before code** | `brainstorming` skill with HARD-GATE | No equivalent — `/plan` goes straight to beads/branch |
| **Git worktree isolation** | `using-git-worktrees` skill | Not in Forge workflow |
| **Systematic debugging** | `systematic-debugging` (4 phases) | No equivalent |
| **Verification before done** | `verification-before-completion` | Implicit in `/check` but not explicit |
| **Meta-skill authoring** | `writing-skills` skill | No equivalent |
| **Two-stage code review** | spec compliance → code quality | Single-stage review |
| **Hard gate enforcement** | `<HARD-GATE>` tags | Soft instructions only |
| **Design docs** | Saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` | Research docs only (`docs/research/`) |
| **Plugin distribution** | Claude Code + Cursor marketplace | Not distributable as plugin |

### What Forge Has That Superpowers Doesn't

| Capability | Forge | Superpowers Status |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Web research stage** | `/research` + parallel AI search | No research phase |
| **Formal spec proposals** | OpenSpec (`openspec/changes/`) | No equivalent |
| **Issue tracking** | Beads (`bd create`, `bd update`) | `obra/issue-cards` (separate repo, not integrated) |
| **Multi-agent file support** | AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md | Claude Code + Cursor only |
| **Security analysis** | OWASP per feature in `/dev` | No security phase |
| **Full PR lifecycle** | `/ship`, `/review`, `/premerge`, `/verify` | Only `finishing-a-development-branch` |
| **SonarCloud integration** | `/sonarcloud` command | None |
| **Greptile integration** | `.claude/rules/greptile-review-process.md` | None |
| **Post-merge verification** | `/verify` | None |

## Integration Options

### Option A: Install Superpowers Plugin Alongside Forge (Non-Breaking)

Install Superpowers as a Claude Code plugin. It adds its skills to your agent's context. Forge commands continue to work. Superpowers skills auto-trigger for gaps Forge doesn't cover.

**Benefit**: Immediately gets brainstorming gate, systematic debugging, git worktrees, verification
**Risk**: Workflow overlap — both have planning, review phases. Agent may get confused about which to use.
**Verdict**: Valid short-term, but needs clear role definition in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md

**Source on overlap concerns**: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qlsdjb/superpowers_vs_gsd_vs_others/

### Option B: Cherry-Pick Key Skills Into Forge (Best Fit)

Import specific Superpowers skills into Forge's `skills/` directory:
- `brainstorming` → insert between `/research` and `/plan` as a new stage
- `systematic-debugging` → add as `/debug` command
- `writing-skills` → use for authoring new Forge skills
- `verification-before-completion` → integrate into `/check` command
- HARD-GATE pattern → add to `/research`, `/plan`, `/dev` commands

**Benefit**: Gets Superpowers' best ideas without workflow collision
**Risk**: Maintenance burden — skills diverge from upstream
**Verdict**: Best long-term approach for Forge as a standalone workflow

### Option C: Replace OpenSpec With Superpowers' `writing-plans`

Superpowers' `writing-plans` creates detailed task-level implementation plans. OpenSpec creates formal architecture proposals with `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `plan.md`.

**Assessment**: These solve different problems.
- `writing-plans` → task-level implementation checklist (tactical)
- OpenSpec → architecture-level proposals requiring approval (strategic)
- **Do not replace** — they are complementary. OpenSpec for "what to build", `writing-plans` for "how to build it."

### Option D: Adopt HARD-GATE Pattern Into Forge Commands (Quickest Win)

Add `<HARD-GATE>` blocks to existing Forge commands. Example for `/plan`:

```
<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed to /dev or write any code until:
1. Research doc exists at docs/research/<slug>.md
2. Beads issue is created and in_progress
3. Branch exists at feat/<slug>
</HARD-GATE>
```

**Benefit**: Addresses the core scope discipline problem without changing workflow
**Risk**: None — purely additive
**Verdict**: Should be done immediately regardless of other options

## Key Insight: Skills vs Commands

Superpowers skills auto-trigger. Forge uses explicit commands (`/plan`, `/dev`). These are philosophically different:

- **Forge**: User explicitly controls each stage. Good for learning, transparency.
- **Superpowers**: Agent decides when to invoke skills. Good for autonomy, fewer user interruptions.

For Forge's use case (multi-agent support, OpenSpec, Beads, full PR lifecycle), the explicit command model is correct. But Superpowers' brainstorming gate and systematic debugging are worth importing as skills, not auto-triggers.

## Recommendations for Forge

**Priority 1 (Quick wins, no new features needed):**
1. Adopt `<HARD-GATE>` pattern in `/research`, `/plan`, `/dev` commands — prevents stage-skipping
2. Add `brainstorming` as a new stage between `/research` and `/plan` (or make it optional in `/plan`)
3. Add `verification-before-completion` logic to `/check` command

**Priority 2 (New skills):**
4. Port `systematic-debugging` as `/debug` command
5. Port `writing-skills` as `/skill` command for authoring new Forge skills
6. Add git worktree support to `/dev` command (isolated implementation)

**Priority 3 (Infrastructure):**
7. Explore distributing Forge as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/` directory) — same distribution model as Superpowers
8. Add two-stage code review to `/review` command (spec compliance first, then code quality)

**What NOT to take:**
- Don't replace Beads with `obra/issue-cards` — Beads has cross-session persistence and is already integrated
- Don't replace OpenSpec with `writing-plans` — different purpose levels
- Don't install Superpowers plugin directly — workflow collision risk until roles are defined
