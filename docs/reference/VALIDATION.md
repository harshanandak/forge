# Validation Reference

Forge validation is evidence, not a slogan. Record the command, result, and failure text when validation fails.

## Project Validation

In this repository:

```bash
bun run check
```

`bun run check` runs `scripts/validate.js` in this order:

1. `bun run typecheck`
2. `bun run lint`
3. `bun audit`
4. `node scripts/test.js --validate`

Security audit behavior distinguishes blocking high/critical vulnerabilities from lower-severity warnings.

## Supporting Commands

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test --timeout 15000
bun run validate:yaml
npm pack --dry-run
```

Use `npm pack --dry-run` for package contents and release-readiness checks. It does not publish.

## Agent Stage Validation

`/validate` is an agent workflow stage. It may include rebase/freshness checks, local validation, manual security review, and Beads context updates according to the installed stage instructions.

Do not confuse:

- `/validate` - agent stage workflow
- `forge-preflight` - prerequisite checker
- `bun run check` - repository validation script

## Work Artifact Paths

Current planning and validation evidence should point to:

```text
docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
```

Legacy `docs/research/` or `docs/plans/` examples are historical unless a specific tool documents a compatibility fallback.

## Failure Recovery

Fix failures in order:

1. Typecheck
2. Lint
3. Security audit
4. Tests
5. Packaging

For each failure:

1. Reproduce with the exact command.
2. Read the first real error.
3. Fix the root cause.
4. Rerun the full validation command.

Do not proceed to ship with "should pass" or stale output.

## Documentation Changes

For docs-only changes, still run:

```bash
bun run check
npm pack --dry-run
```

Run a Markdown link check when available. If adding docs tooling would broaden the PR, file follow-up work instead.
