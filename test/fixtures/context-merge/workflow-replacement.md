# Project Instructions

This is a backend API service for processing payments.

## Our Workflow

We follow a simple 3-step workflow:

1. Create feature branch
2. Write code and tests
3. Create PR and merge

## TDD Approach

We try to write tests first, but it's not strictly enforced.

## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- Squash merge into main
- Delete branches after merge

## Project Description

Payment processing API with webhook handlers for multiple providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square).
